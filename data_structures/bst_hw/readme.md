# Binary Search Trees Homework

This assignment will about implementing Binary Search Trees.

## Task 1.

Implement all missing functionalities from the Binary Search Tree.
You can see in the code of the `bst.py` file, the functions there.
You have to implement the missing part of those that have `raise NotImplementedError()`.

I recommend looking at the pseudocode of the book, and implementing the code from there.

Things to implement:

- `inorder_tree_walk`
- `search`: recursively
- `iterative_search`: iteratively 
- `minimum`
- `maximum`
- `successor`
- `predecessor`
- `tree_insert_node`
- `tree_delete`


After the code is completed, running the code (for eg: with `uv run bst.py`) should not raise any errors and any time the `is_BST()` method is called, it should be giving `True`.
